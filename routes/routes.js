            "desc": "The superstar behind the famous label Shriya Som, Shriya Bhupal is a prominent fashion industry. Having showcased her work in fashion shows and exhibitions across the country, designer Shriya Bhupal in an exclusive chat with Pinkvilla, gave us some much-needed wedding outfit tips, about the latest trends and much more. Shriya also shared the inputs regarding the trousseau, and styles and silhouettes that are huge this season. Which are the colours that are raging super big this festive season? People, unfortunately, do not have the luxury of time off late, in this case, how can one put together a last-minute look? By mixing the styles and experimenting. Looking at a wardrobe full of clothes and yet having nothing to wear is a dilemma we all go through. The best scenario here would be to put together styles to create an entirely new outfit - saves you time + money. For someone who isn't purely desi, what should those guys opt for? The wedding season is just around the corner, so what are the hues that every bride must opt for? Destination weddings are the new in thing, so what should one carry to for the wedding without paying excess baggage? If you were attending your best friends wedding what would you wear for the haldi ceremony, sangeet and wedding? For the haldi, it would be a minimal ruffled lehenga in a pastel color because it's light & easy. For the Sangeet, my pick would be a heavily embellished lehenga topped with a fur cape. And for the wedding, I would pick a chiffon tie-up blouse and a floral embellished lehenga. It's modern, yet dramatic. One major no-no that a bride must never do on her big day? One trend which is way too passe? A matchy bride ie. lipstick being red outfit being red and red nails. It's way too overdone. Earlier this year, Shriya got married to Anindith Reddy in Hyderabad on July 6. The designer got married in a grand wedding in July attended by many renowned designers and celebrities from the film industry. Anindith is the eldest son of Vishweshwar Reddy, sitting MP of Chevella and one of the richest politicians in Telangana.",

Since the time he was born, he often becomes the topic of discussion all thanks to his cuteness and adorable eyes. A year after he was born, we got to see another cutie and that's Inaaya Naumi Kemmu. Both the cousins have been making people go aww over them and their photos, of course, go instantly viral on the Internet. Today, the paparazzi snapped both Taimur and Inaaya enjoying their playtime together. Taimur, who has become paparazzi's favourite was seen waving and talking to them while the photogs clicked him. Baby Tim looked cute as a button wearing a blue striped T-Shirt and blue denim shorts with a pair of blue sneakers. On the other hand, Inaaya was seen nestled in the arms of her nanny wearing a collared floral printed frock, white shoes and bow-style headband. Check out the adorable photos of Taimur and Inaaya below and tell us about it in the comments section. Recently, reports suggested that Saif Ali Khan and Kareena wanted to keep Taimur away from the shutterbugs for now. But, Saif dismissed the rumours stating that these speculations were false. Meanwhile, in an EXCLUSIVE interview with Pinkvilla, Saif spoke candidly to us about how Taimur has changed Saifeena's life. \"Our timings have changed. We've become more responsible. We sleep earlier. We wake up earlier because he is up at the crack of dawn. Your mental timetable is more based around him than around yourself. And that's a welcome change. I like a bit more stable routine and he is helping me do that. I'm very happy about it!,\" Saif gushed about Taimur.",

            "desc": "Ayodhya: Faizabad district will be renamed as Sri Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced on Tuesday but remained silent on the construction of the Ram Temple in a Diwali speech from the holy city revered by millions of Hindus as the birthplace of Lord Ram. Continuing the renaming spree that started with changing the name of Allahabad to Prayagraj, the UP CM said that the Faizabad district, of which Ayodhya city is a part, would be known by its \"original name\". Addressing a huge gathering comprising Hindu seers who chanted \"mandir ka nirman karo (build the temple,\" Adityanath also announced that his government will build an airport in Ayodhya and name it after Lord Ram and a medical college will be named after his father, Dashratha. \"We have come to assure you that no power can do injustice with Ayodhya. Every Indian knows what Ayodhya wants,\" he said, alluding to the construction of the Ram Mandir at the disputed Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi site. The CM's announcement, which he himself had described as \"good news\", is being largely seen as a Hindutva push by the BJP before next year's Lok Sabha elections. It comes amid a growing clamour from BJP leaders and members of Sangh outfits for the Centre to bring a law to facilitate the construction of Ram Temple, citing \"frustration\" in the delay in hearings in the Supreme Court. Responding to criticism of his renaming spree, he said a name holds a lot of significance in this country. \"Why are those protesting the change not named Raavan or Duryodhan? Why didn't their parents name them 'Raavan' and 'Duryodhan' in that case?\" he asked. The name change comes as members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas were raising demands that the sister towns of Faizabad and Ayodhya be merged and renamed \"Shri Ayodhya.\" \"The decision by the Yogi Adityanath government to change the name of Allahabad to Prayagraj is commendable. Our governments should keep in mind the sentiments of the people and also change the name of Faizabad to Shri Ayodhya,\" VHP spokesperson Sharad Sharma had said. The BJP government had earlier renamed two railway stations - one near Agra which was called Farah and another that used to be known as Mughalsarai junction - after the party ideologue Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya.",

            "desc": "Ben Foakes hit a defiant and unbeaten 87 on debut to guide England to 321/8 -- after Sri Lanka claimed cheap early wickets -- at the end of the first day of the first Test. The Surrey wicket-keeper batsman, who knows this could just be a one-off chance as Jonny Bairstow regains fitness, came in with England precariously placed on 103 for five on a Galle pitch notorious for low scores. Foakes built crucial partnerships including an 88-run seventh wicket stand with Sam Curran, who made 48, to defy Sri Lanka's bowlers. England elected to bat first in what was Sri Lankan spin legend Rangana Herath's farewell match. The right-handed Foakes steadied the innings reaching his half-century early in the final session as the tourists lost just three wickets after lunch. Foakes put on 61 for the sixth wicket with Jos Buttler, who was eventually caught behind off Dilruwan Perera for 38. Left-hander Curran attacked the bowling, hitting one four and three sixes before falling two short of his fifty to spinner Akila Dananjaya. Adil Rashid made a useful 35 in a stand of 54 with Foakes that increased the frustration for Sri Lanka's bowlers before he became Perera's fourth victim of the day. Jack Leach, batting on 14, then survived some anxious moments in the final two overs to give Foakes a chance to complete a momentous debut ton on day two. Sri Lanka's veteran spinner Rangana Herath claimed his 100th Test scalp at Galle after sending back England skipper Joe Root in the opening session. Only two other bowlers have achieved 100 Test wickets on one ground -- Herath's legendary compatriot Muttiah Muralitharan who achieved it at Galle, Kandy and SSC Colombo, and England paceman James Anderson at Lord's. Herath notched up the milestone when Root came down the wicket and missed after a breezy 35. Root had also steadied England when they stumbled to 10 for 2 after debutant opener Rory Burns was caught behind off Surange Lakmal for nine and Moeen Ali was bowled next ball. Surrey left-hander Burns had been given the tough task of replacing stalwart Alastair Cook following his retirement in September. After Root's dismissal, Perera skittled Keaton Jennings four short of his 50 before bowling Ben Stokes around his legs for seven as he attempted to sweep.",

            "desc": "A project that has forced Julia Roberts out of hermitage automatically raises expectations. But does her latest, Homecoming, which marks her debut in digital entertainment, live up to it? The 10-episode thriller on Amazon Prime, directed by Sam Esmail (of Mr Robot fame) and co-starring Bobby Cannavale, Stephan James and Shea Whigham, revolves around a small-town waitress Heidi Bergman (Roberts). Only Bergman was earlier a high-profile counsellor at Geist, a private company that along with producing washing powders and drain cleaners, also helps soldiers transition into civilian life. Bergman however, doesn't remember anything about her job. When a stray complaint against the company troubles calm waters, a cesspool of memories and betrayals get stirred up. If you judge by the standards of a thriller, Homecoming is a tad underwhelming. The suspense element works only at a tertiary level and if you are looking for a racy twister, you have hit the wrong button. What series writers Micah Bloomberg and Eli Horowitz do instead is focus on dystopic inner lives in a world where innocence, trust and honesty - qualities which are conventionally upheld as aspirational and commendable - are playthings in the hands of the powerful. In many ways in fact, the series, alternating between the past and the present, resonates Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot as an unseen, all-powerful and ruthless corporate god plays with his humans - and what makes them human - for unknowable ends. The primal emotion of the series is that of searing disconnect. As the principal characters skid around the play board of their lives trying to make sense of what had or is happening to them, almost all of them come across as islands tossing in the sea of humanity around them. They talk to each other and sometimes connect, but a sense of all-pervasive dissociation and disquiet is never too far. Whether it is Heidi Bergman who doesn't know who she is, the slick-tongued Colin Belfast (Cannavale) who seems to run the show, or the conscientious Thomas Carrasco (Whigham), a government employee who doggedly goes about his job knowing well he has very little actual agency - the characters exist in an emotional vacuum. I especially loved Esmail's construction of this alone-ness and loneliness on screen, done as much through meticulously fleshed out characters as clever camera work. Note the repeated top shots, always watching - like the third eye - as people go about their daily business in honeycomb-esque constructions. Homecoming also turns the lens on an increasingly scrutinising and de-humanising state. What is supposed to nurture and enrich takes on the guise of benevolence to squeeze out one's very life-force. Unquestioning conformation is the order of the day and if you resist, there are always the weapons of \"paranoia\" and \"mental imbalance\". In short, you either eat or be eaten - it's as simple as that. Rings some bells? As far as standout performances go, Roberts, with her listening face, is just right as Heidi Bergman. But does she leave you feeling wowed? Not really. She hits all the right notes but doesn't quite become superlative. It's rather Whigham who leaves a lasting impression as the conscientious man in a thankless job. Like Roberts, his is a listening character, but the intensity he brings to the table with very little weaponry is remarkable. All said and done, Homecoming is uneven with quite a few brilliantly crafted scenes that light up the mostly flat narrative. It doesn't blow you away. But it is its notes of poignancy that eventually nestle in an unsuspecting corner of your brain to pose some niggling questions.

On the same lines, India's hockey captain Manpreet Singh, who will lead India in the upcoming Odisha Hockey Men's World Cup, also urged the avid hockey buffs to watch the matches in the stadium instead of sitting in their homes. In a video put out by the Hockey India on its official Twitter account, Manpreet said, \"It is altogether a different vibe when you see the live match in a stadium. When the matches are telecast on television, you can only see a couple of angles and you may miss all the enthralling action. But when you see the action live in the stadium, the run and energy of players invigorates fun. It is proud feeling that India is hosting the Hockey World Cup. I would urge all people to buy tickets and watch matches in the stadium.\" Manpreet also feels that the team has to refine their approach in attack and defence before they begin their campaign. \"We had not lost a single match at the Asian Champions Trophy which gave a morale boost to the team. We have to work more on our attack and defence,\" he stated. Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik also launched a technology-driven and citizen-friendly MoBus service in capital Bhubaneswar ahead of the World Cup.

            "desc": "England's Ben Foakes made a memorable debut to help the tourists recover from a terrible start and reach 321 for eight wickets on the opening day of the first Test against Sri Lanka on Tuesday. With England reeling at 10 for two and then 103 for five, even the 200-mark looked difficult but Foakes forged 50-plus stands with Jos Buttler and Sam Curran to drag them back into the contest. Foakes, replacing the injured Jonny Bairstow in the side, was batting on 87 at stumps, having been impressive with his batting while his glovework remains to be seen. Jack Leach was on 14 at the other end after quite a turnaround by the tourists in the last two sessions. England had earlier made an unconvincing start to life following the retirement of stalwart Alastair Cook after captain Joe Root opted to bat first to avoid the prospect of having the final innings at a famously spin-friendly venue. It was the early pace of Suranga Lakmal, however, that undid the top order of a side playing their first Test without England great Cook who left the international arena in September. Opener Rory Burns (nine) disappointed on his Test debut and Moeen Ali failed to justify his promotion to number three as Lakmal claimed two wickets in two balls. Root denied Lakmal a hat-trick and started the rebuilding job, initially at a run-a-ball rate, with Keaton Jennings. Sri Lanka wasted both their reviews inside 12 overs but it was the golden arm of retiring 40-year-old Rangana Herath that ended Root's 62-run stand with Jennings. Herath, given a guard-of-honour by his team mates ahead of his 93rd and final Test, yorked an advancing Root to claim his 100th wicket at the venue where he made his Test debut in 1999. Root hit five boundaries in a fluent 35 before paying for his recklessness. Dilruwan Perera (4-70) dismissed Jennings for 46 and Ben Stokes for seven in his second spell, clean bowling both the left-handers. Buttler and Foakes sensibly abandoned the ultra-aggressive batting which had cost England dear in the morning session and combined in a 61-run stand for the sixth wicket. Even after Perera dismissed Buttler for 38, Foakes raised 88 runs with Curran, who hit three sixes before falling for 48, while Adil Rashid contributed a quickfire 35 down the order.",

Have cancelled all functions for 3 days &am not taking calls. Pls don't listen to rumours.\" A couple of days ago, with the Ram Mandir movement gathering momentum, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has said no Hindu text condones the use of violence to get one's way and scriptures say people should build Ram in their hearts. \"In fact, if anything, there is a scripture that says build Ram in your heart.

Tharoor reiterated his point asking if a good Hindu would want to build a Ram Temple at the expense of an act of violence. \"My only point is, would a Hindu have wanted to build such a precious place at the expense of conducting an act of violence. A good Hindu is a law-abiding Hindu. A good Hindu is someone who has 'insaaniyat',\" the Congress leader asked.

But where have we been told in our Hindu texts and our Hindu teachings which, in fact since the days of Adi Shankaracharya, have emphasized much more on ahimsa. Where have we been told that we should conduct violence against other people to have our way,\" questioned Tharoor. The Lok Sabha MP from Thiruvananthapuram also wondered what about his remarks had \"shocked the BJP so much\". He said, \"Most good Hindus I know would want a Ram Temple at the place where they believe he was born. But most good Hindus would not have wanted it by demolishing other people's place of worship. And this is more or less what Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani also said.\" The Congress leader quoted Advani as having called the day of demolition of Babri Masjid as the \"saddest day of his life\". \"Advani said he would have respectfully wanted to relocate the site and Vajpayee had also hinted at all sorts of compromises provided the Ram Temple could also be built, it could even be a joint wall between a mosque and a temple. Who knows what Vajpayee would have wanted? He is not here to tell us but no, neither of them ever spoke in terms of demolishing the mosque and when it happened they both condemned it. So what am I saying that is so shocking for the BJP?\" asked Tharoor. On the perception that majority Hindus want a Ram Temple at the site where evidence also suggests that a temple existed, Tharoor said this was an academic argument. \"A temple really did exist. Whether it was the Ram Temple we don't know. Definitely there were pillars underneath. But given the experiences of that period so many temples were destroyed and mosques built in their places. I am not challenging the historical veracity of this belief, that debate is over. That's totally academic now,\" said the Congress MP. The Congress leader acknowledged that \"the important thing is that an overwhelming majority of Hindus particularly in north India believe this was where Lord Ram was born and where there should be a Mandir\", but went on to add, \"to my mind arguing that point is academic.\" He then asked if a Hindu would ever want to build such a precious place, a temple, at the expense of conducting an act of violence. To a pointed query on whether he personally wanted a Ram Temple at the stated site, Tharoor said, \"I have said as much as I wanted to say.\"",

            "desc": "Lara took to golf in 1994 after he beat Sir Garfield Sober's record of the highest Test knock and has won titles in the Caribbean. Moving or bouncing, a cricket ball was never a concern for Brian Lara but one of the most destructive batsmen ever ended up with a headache while trying to control \"silly little golf balls\". \"Yes, golf is a weird game. I was capable of dealing with moving and bouncing cricket balls, but this little silly ball, sitting on the ground, gave me quite a headache early on for few years, but taught me how to be disciplined in controlling the ball,\" Lara told PTI on Tuesday speaking about his love for the game. Lara took to golf in 1994 after he beat Sir Garfield Sober's record of the highest Test knock and has won titles in the Caribbean. Speaking about other cricketers, who have taken to golf, Lara said while Kapil Dev and Jacques Kallis' love for the sport is well known, former Australian captain Ricky Ponting is among the best. \"We have been hearing about Jacques Kallis and Kapil Dev, but the best that I have seen is Ricky Ponting. His putting is a little better and he is consistent on that front,\" he said. Lara also recalled an instance of playin alongside Kapil Dev in an American tournament. \"We were playing in a tournament in the US. I was up against an American amateur. He defeated me. After that I went up to Kapil and said, 'this American guy is unbelievable'. Kapil nodded funnily and went against him. He returned only to tell me he cleaned the American in 15 holes. That is Kapil, a proper golfer here,\" he said. Lara said he focused more on cricket than golf because he felt the game would affect his batting. \"Pretty early, when I started playing golf, I was compared to Garfield Sobers, who played both cricket and golf. In cricket, you should keep your wrist as straight as possible, unlike golf. \"This itself was a problem, and hence, I did not play much of golf in my playing days,\" said the legendary left-hander. There were not many left-handed golfers too. I did switch to play right-handed pretty soon, but did not felt comfortable because playing left-handed in cricket came naturally to me. This also made me focus not much on golf,\" he said.",

So it came as a surprise when the founder of Microsoft brandished a jar of human waste at a forum on the future of the toilet in Beijing on Tuesday. The stunt was an effort to draw attention to a problem affecting developing countries around the world: not enough toilets. \"In places without sanitation you have got way more than that,\" Gates said, pointing to the feces inside the clear canister resting on a table. \"And that's what kids when they are out playing, they are being exposed to all the time, and that's why we connect this not just with quality of life, but with disease and death and with malnutrition,\" he told attendees. The billionaire said more than half of the world's population suffers without clean, comfortable sanitation facilities. \"When you think of things that are basic right up there with health and enough to eat, you think that having a reasonable toilet certainly belongs on that list,\" Gates said. Gates has previously used shock tactics to draw attention to his disease-battling efforts. In 2009, he loosed mosquitoes at a Technology, Entertainment, Design (TED) Conference in California to make a point about the deadly sting of malaria - waiting a minute or so before assuring the audience the liberated insects were disease-free. Gates was in Beijing on Tuesday for the \"Reinvented Toilet Expo\", a forum hosted by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation showcasing various cutting edge toilet technology in lieu of sewers, making them easier and cheaper to install the devices. The world's number two economy is in the midst of a drive to improve its notoriously malodorous bathrooms, a campaign President Xi Jinping has dubbed the \"toilet revolution.\" \"China has made great progress in improving health and sanitation for millions of people,\" Gates said. \"China has an opportunity to launch a new category of innovated non-sewered sanitation solutions that will benefit millions of people worldwide.\" According to UNICEF, 892 million people worldwide have no choice but to defecate in the open. India's government says its public health drive has slashed the number of people in the country forced to defecate in the open from 550 million in 2014 to less than 150 million today.",

He will also be shown a video at the guest house within the temple premises to apprise him about the progress of the projects at the township, Singh said further. The foundation stone of Kedarpuri reconstruction projects was laid by Modi during his visit to the temple in 2017. Snowfall in the higher reaches of the mountains of Uttarakhand has enhanced the beauty of the temple and its surroundings. All preparations have been made in view of the prime minister's visit with the road from the helipad to the temple totally cleared of snow, Singh said. Several new features including a meditation cave 400 metres above Kedarnath will greet Modi during his visit this time. Built at a secluded spot 400 metres above the shrine, the cave will be shown to the prime minister from a distance as he is not scheduled to go there, Rudraprayag district magistrate Mangesh Ghildiyal said. Other new features for Modi to see at the shrine this time will be a much wider Mukhya Aksha, the passage from the point of confluence of Mandakini and Saraswati to the facade of the temple and the retaining walls constructed on the banks of the two rivers, the official said. Kedarpuri reconstruction has been on Modi's priority list and he keeps monitoring its progress on regular intervals via video conferencing.

Having showcased her work in fashion shows and exhibitions across the country, designer Shriya Bhupal in an exclusive chat with Pinkvilla, gave us some much-needed wedding outfit tips, about the latest trends and much more. Shriya also shared the inputs regarding the trousseau, and styles and silhouettes that are huge this season. Which are the colours that are raging super big this festive season? People, unfortunately, do not have the luxury of time off late, in this case, how can one put together a last-minute look? By mixing the styles and experimenting. Looking at a wardrobe full of clothes and yet having nothing to wear is a dilemma we all go through. The best scenario here would be to put together styles to create an entirely new outfit - saves you time + money. For someone who isn't purely desi, what should those guys opt for? The wedding season is just around the corner, so what are the hues that every bride must opt for? Destination weddings are the new in thing, so what should one carry to for the wedding without paying excess baggage? If you were attending your best friends wedding what would you wear for the haldi ceremony, sangeet and wedding? For the haldi, it would be a minimal ruffled lehenga in a pastel color because it's light & easy. For the Sangeet, my pick would be a heavily embellished lehenga topped with a fur cape. And for the wedding, I would pick a chiffon tie-up blouse and a floral embellished lehenga. It's modern, yet dramatic. One major no-no that a bride must never do on her big day? One trend which is way too passe? A matchy bride ie. lipstick being red outfit being red and red nails. It's way too overdone. Earlier this year, Shriya got married to Anindith Reddy in Hyderabad on July 6. The designer got married in a grand wedding in July attended by many renowned designers and celebrities from the film industry. Anindith is the eldest son of Vishweshwar Reddy, sitting MP of Chevella and one of the richest politicians in Telangana.",

Continuing the renaming spree that started with changing the name of Allahabad to Prayagraj, the UP CM said that the Faizabad district, of which Ayodhya city is a part, would be known by its \"original name\". Addressing a huge gathering comprising Hindu seers who chanted \"mandir ka nirman karo (build the temple,\" Adityanath also announced that his government will build an airport in Ayodhya and name it after Lord Ram and a medical college will be named after his father, Dashratha. \"We have come to assure you that no power can do injustice with Ayodhya. Every Indian knows what Ayodhya wants,\" he said, alluding to the construction of the Ram Mandir at the disputed Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi site. The CM's announcement, which he himself had described as \"good news\", is being largely seen as a Hindutva push by the BJP before next year's Lok Sabha elections. It comes amid a growing clamour from BJP leaders and members of Sangh outfits for the Centre to bring a law to facilitate the construction of Ram Temple, citing \"frustration\" in the delay in hearings in the Supreme Court. Responding to criticism of his renaming spree, he said a name holds a lot of significance in this country. \"Why are those protesting the change not named Raavan or Duryodhan? Why didn't their parents name them 'Raavan' and 'Duryodhan' in that case?\" he asked. The name change comes as members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas were raising demands that the sister towns of Faizabad and Ayodhya be merged and renamed \"Shri Ayodhya.\" \"The decision by the Yogi Adityanath government to change the name of Allahabad to Prayagraj is commendable. Our governments should keep in mind the sentiments of the people and also change the name of Faizabad to Shri Ayodhya,\" VHP spokesperson Sharad Sharma had said.

            "desc": "Ben Foakes hit a defiant and unbeaten 87 on debut to guide England to 321/8 -- after Sri Lanka claimed cheap early wickets -- at the end of the first day of the first Test. The Surrey wicket-keeper batsman, who knows this could just be a one-off chance as Jonny Bairstow regains fitness, came in with England precariously placed on 103 for five on a Galle pitch notorious for low scores. Foakes built crucial partnerships including an 88-run seventh wicket stand with Sam Curran, who made 48, to defy Sri Lanka's bowlers. England elected to bat first in what was Sri Lankan spin legend Rangana Herath's farewell match. The right-handed Foakes steadied the innings reaching his half-century early in the final session as the tourists lost just three wickets after lunch. Foakes put on 61 for the sixth wicket with Jos Buttler, who was eventually caught behind off Dilruwan Perera for 38. Left-hander Curran attacked the bowling, hitting one four and three sixes before falling two short of his fifty to spinner Akila Dananjaya. Adil Rashid made a useful 35 in a stand of 54 with Foakes that increased the frustration for Sri Lanka's bowlers before he became Perera's fourth victim of the day. Jack Leach, batting on 14, then survived some anxious moments in the final two overs to give Foakes a chance to complete a momentous debut ton on day two. Sri Lanka's veteran spinner Rangana Herath claimed his 100th Test scalp at Galle after sending back England skipper Joe Root in the opening session. Only two other bowlers have achieved 100 Test wickets on one ground -- Herath's legendary compatriot Muttiah Muralitharan who achieved it at Galle, Kandy and SSC Colombo, and England paceman James Anderson at Lord's. Herath notched up the milestone when Root came down the wicket and missed after a breezy 35. Root had also steadied England when they stumbled to 10 for 2 after debutant opener Rory Burns was caught behind off Surange Lakmal for nine and Moeen Ali was bowled next ball. Surrey left-hander Burns had been given the tough task of replacing stalwart Alastair Cook following his retirement in September. After Root's dismissal, Perera skittled Keaton Jennings four short of his 50 before bowling Ben Stokes around his legs for seven as he attempted to sweep.",

            "desc": "A project that has forced Julia Roberts out of hermitage automatically raises expectations. But does her latest, Homecoming, which marks her debut in digital entertainment, live up to it? The 10-episode thriller on Amazon Prime, directed by Sam Esmail (of Mr Robot fame) and co-starring Bobby Cannavale, Stephan James and Shea Whigham, revolves around a small-town waitress Heidi Bergman (Roberts). Only Bergman was earlier a high-profile counsellor at Geist, a private company that along with producing washing powders and drain cleaners, also helps soldiers transition into civilian life. Bergman however, doesn't remember anything about her job. When a stray complaint against the company troubles calm waters, a cesspool of memories and betrayals get stirred up. If you judge by the standards of a thriller, Homecoming is a tad underwhelming. The suspense element works only at a tertiary level and if you are looking for a racy twister, you have hit the wrong button. What series writers Micah Bloomberg and Eli Horowitz do instead is focus on dystopic inner lives in a world where innocence, trust and honesty - qualities which are conventionally upheld as aspirational and commendable - are playthings in the hands of the powerful. In many ways in fact, the series, alternating between the past and the present, resonates Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot as an unseen, all-powerful and ruthless corporate god plays with his humans - and what makes them human - for unknowable ends. The primal emotion of the series is that of searing disconnect. As the principal characters skid around the play board of their lives trying to make sense of what had or is happening to them, almost all of them come across as islands tossing in the sea of humanity around them. They talk to each other and sometimes connect, but a sense of all-pervasive dissociation and disquiet is never too far. Whether it is Heidi Bergman who doesn't know who she is, the slick-tongued Colin Belfast (Cannavale) who seems to run the show, or the conscientious Thomas Carrasco (Whigham), a government employee who doggedly goes about his job knowing well he has very little actual agency - the characters exist in an emotional vacuum. I especially loved Esmail's construction of this alone-ness and loneliness on screen, done as much through meticulously fleshed out characters as clever camera work. Note the repeated top shots, always watching - like the third eye - as people go about their daily business in honeycomb-esque constructions. Homecoming also turns the lens on an increasingly scrutinising and de-humanising state. What is supposed to nurture and enrich takes on the guise of benevolence to squeeze out one's very life-force. Unquestioning conformation is the order of the day and if you resist, there are always the weapons of \"paranoia\" and \"mental imbalance\". In short, you either eat or be eaten - it's as simple as that. Rings some bells? As far as standout performances go, Roberts, with her listening face, is just right as Heidi Bergman. But does she leave you feeling wowed? Not really. She hits all the right notes but doesn't quite become superlative. It's rather Whigham who leaves a lasting impression as the conscientious man in a thankless job. Like Roberts, his is a listening character, but the intensity he brings to the table with very little weaponry is remarkable. All said and done, Homecoming is uneven with quite a few brilliantly crafted scenes that light up the mostly flat narrative. It doesn't blow you away. But it is its notes of poignancy that eventually nestle in an unsuspecting corner of your brain to pose some niggling questions.

            "desc": "If there is an international cricket match in India, the spectators will automatically throng the stadiums and if you are an ardent cricket fan, you might just get lucky to get a ticket after standing in long queues. But it may not be the case with other sports. Just five months ago, Indian football skipper and one of the best football players of India, Sunil Chhetri made a heartfelt plea to the country to watch matches in the stadium and support the Indian team. On the same lines, India's hockey captain Manpreet Singh, who will lead India in the upcoming Odisha Hockey Men's World Cup, also urged the avid hockey buffs to watch the matches in the stadium instead of sitting in their homes. In a video put out by the Hockey India on its official Twitter account, Manpreet said, \"It is altogether a different vibe when you see the live match in a stadium. When the matches are telecast on television, you can only see a couple of angles and you may miss all the enthralling action. But when you see the action live in the stadium, the run and energy of players invigorates fun. It is proud feeling that India is hosting the Hockey World Cup. I would urge all people to buy tickets and watch matches in the stadium.\" Manpreet also feels that the team has to refine their approach in attack and defence before they begin their campaign. \"We had not lost a single match at the Asian Champions Trophy which gave a morale boost to the team. We have to work more on our attack and defence,\" he stated. Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik also launched a technology-driven and citizen-friendly MoBus service in capital Bhubaneswar ahead of the World Cup. A cycling tour headed by the mascot 'Olly' to promote the World Cup has also reached the Ansuman Memorial cricket tournament in Jajpur district.",

            "desc": "Congress MLA Krishna Chandra Sagaria on Tuesday resigned as member of the Odisha Assembly, protesting \"injustice\" meted out to an alleged gangrape victim of Koraput district, who committed suicide earlier this year. A 14-year-old girl in Kunduli area of Koraput district had alleged that she was gangraped by four men in uniform in October, last year. The police, however, ruled out rape, citing her medical reports. The girl subsequently committed suicide by hanging on January 22, triggering sharp reactions from many quarters. Stating that he had announced his decision to quit as a legislator on October 30, Sagaria, who represented Koraput assembly segment, said he met Assembly Speaker P K Amat on Tuesday morning and submitted his resignation letter. \"I have quit the membership of Odisha Assembly, as I feel I have no moral right to continue as an MLA, having failed to ensure justice in Kunduli gangrape and suicide incident,\" the Congress leader told reporters. Sagaria also said that the speaker hasn't reacted to his move as yet. The Dalit leader, however, clarified he would continue to work for the Congress. He said he was deeply pained to have learned about the fate of the 14-year-old Kunduli girl, earlier this year. \"Being the local representative, I was morally responsible to ensure justice for her,\" he noted. Holding the BJD-led state government responsible for the incident, the Congress leader had earlier alleged that the investigation was \"hushed up\" by the police. He vowed to reach out to the people of Odisha to generate create awareness about the \"increasing atrocities and crimes against women\" in the state. \"I will tell people about the inaction on the part of the state government in providing justice and security to women,\" he had said.",

            "desc": "England's Ben Foakes made a memorable debut to help the tourists recover from a terrible start and reach 321 for eight wickets on the opening day of the first Test against Sri Lanka on Tuesday. With England reeling at 10 for two and then 103 for five, even the 200-mark looked difficult but Foakes forged 50-plus stands with Jos Buttler and Sam Curran to drag them back into the contest. Foakes, replacing the injured Jonny Bairstow in the side, was batting on 87 at stumps, having been impressive with his batting while his glovework remains to be seen. Jack Leach was on 14 at the other end after quite a turnaround by the tourists in the last two sessions. England had earlier made an unconvincing start to life following the retirement of stalwart Alastair Cook after captain Joe Root opted to bat first to avoid the prospect of having the final innings at a famously spin-friendly venue. It was the early pace of Suranga Lakmal, however, that undid the top order of a side playing their first Test without England great Cook who left the international arena in September. Opener Rory Burns (nine) disappointed on his Test debut and Moeen Ali failed to justify his promotion to number three as Lakmal claimed two wickets in two balls. Root denied Lakmal a hat-trick and started the rebuilding job, initially at a run-a-ball rate, with Keaton Jennings. Sri Lanka wasted both their reviews inside 12 overs but it was the golden arm of retiring 40-year-old Rangana Herath that ended Root's 62-run stand with Jennings. Herath, given a guard-of-honour by his team mates ahead of his 93rd and final Test, yorked an advancing Root to claim his 100th wicket at the venue where he made his Test debut in 1999. Root hit five boundaries in a fluent 35 before paying for his recklessness. Dilruwan Perera (4-70) dismissed Jennings for 46 and Ben Stokes for seven in his second spell, clean bowling both the left-handers. Buttler and Foakes sensibly abandoned the ultra-aggressive batting which had cost England dear in the morning session and combined in a 61-run stand for the sixth wicket. Even after Perera dismissed Buttler for 38, Foakes raised 88 runs with Curran, who hit three sixes before falling for 48, while Adil Rashid contributed a quickfire 35 down the order.",

            "desc": "On Tuesday, responding to rumours that he had 'disappeared' Tharoor, a couple of days after his comment on the Ram Mandir movement said he was feeling under the weather and in bed with a bad 'chest infection'. He wrote on Twitter: \"For all my hyper-imaginative friends reading political motives behind my \"disappearance\": I am in bed w/ a bad chest infection, on antibiotics, & have been advised a few days' complete rest. Have cancelled all functions for 3 days &am not taking calls. Pls don't listen to rumours.\" A couple of days ago, with the Ram Mandir movement gathering momentum, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has said no Hindu text condones the use of violence to get one's way and scriptures say people should build Ram in their hearts. \"In fact, if anything, there is a scripture that says build Ram in your heart. And if Ram is built in our heart it should little matter where else he is or he is not, because he is everywhere,\" Tharoor said in an exclusive interview to PTI. The Congress MP was responding to a question about his recent remark that no good Hindu would want a temple at the disputed Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site. Tharoor reiterated his point asking if a good Hindu would want to build a Ram Temple at the expense of an act of violence. \"My only point is, would a Hindu have wanted to build such a precious place at the expense of conducting an act of violence. A good Hindu is a law-abiding Hindu. A good Hindu is someone who has 'insaaniyat',\" the Congress leader asked. He went on to argue that while a good Hindu was also obviously somebody who worshipped and believed in his worship, Hindu scriptures do not allow the use of violence to have one's way. \"A good Hindu is also obviously somebody who worships and believes in his worship. But where have we been told in our Hindu texts and our Hindu teachings which, in fact since the days of Adi Shankaracharya, have emphasized much more on ahimsa. Where have we been told that we should conduct violence against other people to have our way,\" questioned Tharoor. The Lok Sabha MP from Thiruvananthapuram also wondered what about his remarks had \"shocked the BJP so much\". He said, \"Most good Hindus I know would want a Ram Temple at the place where they believe he was born. But most good Hindus would not have wanted it by demolishing other people's place of worship. And this is more or less what Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani also said.\" The Congress leader quoted Advani as having called the day of demolition of Babri Masjid as the \"saddest day of his life\". \"Advani said he would have respectfully wanted to relocate the site and Vajpayee had also hinted at all sorts of compromises provided the Ram Temple could also be built, it could even be a joint wall between a mosque and a temple. Who knows what Vajpayee would have wanted? He is not here to tell us but no, neither of them ever spoke in terms of demolishing the mosque and when it happened they both condemned it. So what am I saying that is so shocking for the BJP?\" asked Tharoor. On the perception that majority Hindus want a Ram Temple at the site where evidence also suggests that a temple existed, Tharoor said this was an academic argument. \"A temple really did exist. Whether it was the Ram Temple we don't know. Definitely there were pillars underneath. But given the experiences of that period so many temples were destroyed and mosques built in their places. I am not challenging the historical veracity of this belief, that debate is over. That's totally academic now,\" said the Congress MP. The Congress leader acknowledged that \"the important thing is that an overwhelming majority of Hindus particularly in north India believe this was where Lord Ram was born and where there should be a Mandir\", but went on to add, \"to my mind arguing that point is academic.\" He then asked if a Hindu would ever want to build such a precious place, a temple, at the expense of conducting an act of violence. To a pointed query on whether he personally wanted a Ram Temple at the stated site, Tharoor said, \"I have said as much as I wanted to say.\"",

Moving or bouncing, a cricket ball was never a concern for Brian Lara but one of the most destructive batsmen ever ended up with a headache while trying to control \"silly little golf balls\". \"Yes, golf is a weird game. I was capable of dealing with moving and bouncing cricket balls, but this little silly ball, sitting on the ground, gave me quite a headache early on for few years, but taught me how to be disciplined in controlling the ball,\" Lara told PTI on Tuesday speaking about his love for the game. Lara took to golf in 1994 after he beat Sir Garfield Sober's record of the highest Test knock and has won titles in the Caribbean. Speaking about other cricketers, who have taken to golf, Lara said while Kapil Dev and Jacques Kallis' love for the sport is well known, former Australian captain Ricky Ponting is among the best. \"We have been hearing about Jacques Kallis and Kapil Dev, but the best that I have seen is Ricky Ponting. His putting is a little better and he is consistent on that front,\" he said. Lara also recalled an instance of playin alongside Kapil Dev in an American tournament. \"We were playing in a tournament in the US. I was up against an American amateur. He defeated me. After that I went up to Kapil and said, 'this American guy is unbelievable'. Kapil nodded funnily and went against him. He returned only to tell me he cleaned the American in 15 holes. That is Kapil, a proper golfer here,\" he said. Lara said he focused more on cricket than golf because he felt the game would affect his batting. \"Pretty early, when I started playing golf, I was compared to Garfield Sobers, who played both cricket and golf. In cricket, you should keep your wrist as straight as possible, unlike golf. \"This itself was a problem, and hence, I did not play much of golf in my playing days,\" said the legendary left-hander. There were not many left-handed golfers too. I did switch to play right-handed pretty soon, but did not felt comfortable because playing left-handed in cricket came naturally to me. This also made me focus not much on golf,\" he said.",

So it came as a surprise when the founder of Microsoft brandished a jar of human waste at a forum on the future of the toilet in Beijing on Tuesday. The stunt was an effort to draw attention to a problem affecting developing countries around the world: not enough toilets. \"In places without sanitation you have got way more than that,\" Gates said, pointing to the feces inside the clear canister resting on a table. \"And that's what kids when they are out playing, they are being exposed to all the time, and that's why we connect this not just with quality of life, but with disease and death and with malnutrition,\" he told attendees. The billionaire said more than half of the world's population suffers without clean, comfortable sanitation facilities. \"When you think of things that are basic right up there with health and enough to eat, you think that having a reasonable toilet certainly belongs on that list,\" Gates said. Gates has previously used shock tactics to draw attention to his disease-battling efforts. In 2009, he loosed mosquitoes at a Technology, Entertainment, Design (TED) Conference in California to make a point about the deadly sting of malaria - waiting a minute or so before assuring the audience the liberated insects were disease-free. Gates was in Beijing on Tuesday for the \"Reinvented Toilet Expo\", a forum hosted by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation showcasing various cutting edge toilet technology in lieu of sewers, making them easier and cheaper to install the devices. The world's number two economy is in the midst of a drive to improve its notoriously malodorous bathrooms, a campaign President Xi Jinping has dubbed the \"toilet revolution.\" \"China has made great progress in improving health and sanitation for millions of people,\" Gates said. \"China has an opportunity to launch a new category of innovated non-sewered sanitation solutions that will benefit millions of people worldwide.\" According to UNICEF, 892 million people worldwide have no choice but to defecate in the open. India's government says its public health drive has slashed the number of people in the country forced to defecate in the open from 550 million in 2014 to less than 150 million today.",

Having showcased her work in fashion shows and exhibitions across the country, designer Shriya Bhupal in an exclusive chat with Pinkvilla, gave us some much-needed wedding outfit tips, about the latest trends and much more. Shriya also shared the inputs regarding the trousseau, and styles and silhouettes that are huge this season. Which are the colours that are raging super big this festive season? People, unfortunately, do not have the luxury of time off late, in this case, how can one put together a last-minute look? By mixing the styles and experimenting. Looking at a wardrobe full of clothes and yet having nothing to wear is a dilemma we all go through. The best scenario here would be to put together styles to create an entirely new outfit - saves you time + money. For someone who isn't purely desi, what should those guys opt for? The wedding season is just around the corner, so what are the hues that every bride must opt for? Destination weddings are the new in thing, so what should one carry to for the wedding without paying excess baggage? If you were attending your best friends wedding what would you wear for the haldi ceremony, sangeet and wedding? For the haldi, it would be a minimal ruffled lehenga in a pastel color because it's light & easy. For the Sangeet, my pick would be a heavily embellished lehenga topped with a fur cape. And for the wedding, I would pick a chiffon tie-up blouse and a floral embellished lehenga. It's modern, yet dramatic. One major no-no that a bride must never do on her big day? One trend which is way too passe? A matchy bride ie. lipstick being red outfit being red and red nails. It's way too overdone. Earlier this year, Shriya got married to Anindith Reddy in Hyderabad on July 6. The designer got married in a grand wedding in July attended by many renowned designers and celebrities from the film industry.

            "desc": "We have to just accept the fact that we will never stop gushing over Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan's baby boy Taimur Ali Khan. Since the time he was born, he often becomes the topic of discussion all thanks to his cuteness and adorable eyes. A year after he was born, we got to see another cutie and that's Inaaya Naumi Kemmu. Both the cousins have been making people go aww over them and their photos, of course, go instantly viral on the Internet. Today, the paparazzi snapped both Taimur and Inaaya enjoying their playtime together. Taimur, who has become paparazzi's favourite was seen waving and talking to them while the photogs clicked him. Baby Tim looked cute as a button wearing a blue striped T-Shirt and blue denim shorts with a pair of blue sneakers. On the other hand, Inaaya was seen nestled in the arms of her nanny wearing a collared floral printed frock, white shoes and bow-style headband. Check out the adorable photos of Taimur and Inaaya below and tell us about it in the comments section. Recently, reports suggested that Saif Ali Khan and Kareena wanted to keep Taimur away from the shutterbugs for now. But, Saif dismissed the rumours stating that these speculations were false. Meanwhile, in an EXCLUSIVE interview with Pinkvilla, Saif spoke candidly to us about how Taimur has changed Saifeena's life. \"Our timings have changed. We've become more responsible. We sleep earlier. We wake up earlier because he is up at the crack of dawn. Your mental timetable is more based around him than around yourself. And that's a welcome change. I like a bit more stable routine and he is helping me do that. I'm very happy about it!,\" Saif gushed about Taimur.",

            "desc": "Ayodhya: Faizabad district will be renamed as Sri Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced on Tuesday but remained silent on the construction of the Ram Temple in a Diwali speech from the holy city revered by millions of Hindus as the birthplace of Lord Ram. Continuing the renaming spree that started with changing the name of Allahabad to Prayagraj, the UP CM said that the Faizabad district, of which Ayodhya city is a part, would be known by its \"original name\". Addressing a huge gathering comprising Hindu seers who chanted \"mandir ka nirman karo (build the temple,\" Adityanath also announced that his government will build an airport in Ayodhya and name it after Lord Ram and a medical college will be named after his father, Dashratha. \"We have come to assure you that no power can do injustice with Ayodhya. Every Indian knows what Ayodhya wants,\" he said, alluding to the construction of the Ram Mandir at the disputed Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi site. The CM's announcement, which he himself had described as \"good news\", is being largely seen as a Hindutva push by the BJP before next year's Lok Sabha elections. It comes amid a growing clamour from BJP leaders and members of Sangh outfits for the Centre to bring a law to facilitate the construction of Ram Temple, citing \"frustration\" in the delay in hearings in the Supreme Court. Responding to criticism of his renaming spree, he said a name holds a lot of significance in this country. \"Why are those protesting the change not named Raavan or Duryodhan? Why didn't their parents name them 'Raavan' and 'Duryodhan' in that case?\" he asked. The name change comes as members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas were raising demands that the sister towns of Faizabad and Ayodhya be merged and renamed \"Shri Ayodhya.\" \"The decision by the Yogi Adityanath government to change the name of Allahabad to Prayagraj is commendable. Our governments should keep in mind the sentiments of the people and also change the name of Faizabad to Shri Ayodhya,\" VHP spokesperson Sharad Sharma had said. The BJP government had earlier renamed two railway stations - one near Agra which was called Farah and another that used to be known as Mughalsarai junction - after the party ideologue Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya.",

            "desc": "Ben Foakes hit a defiant and unbeaten 87 on debut to guide England to 321/8 -- after Sri Lanka claimed cheap early wickets -- at the end of the first day of the first Test. The Surrey wicket-keeper batsman, who knows this could just be a one-off chance as Jonny Bairstow regains fitness, came in with England precariously placed on 103 for five on a Galle pitch notorious for low scores. Foakes built crucial partnerships including an 88-run seventh wicket stand with Sam Curran, who made 48, to defy Sri Lanka's bowlers. England elected to bat first in what was Sri Lankan spin legend Rangana Herath's farewell match. The right-handed Foakes steadied the innings reaching his half-century early in the final session as the tourists lost just three wickets after lunch. Foakes put on 61 for the sixth wicket with Jos Buttler, who was eventually caught behind off Dilruwan Perera for 38. Left-hander Curran attacked the bowling, hitting one four and three sixes before falling two short of his fifty to spinner Akila Dananjaya. Adil Rashid made a useful 35 in a stand of 54 with Foakes that increased the frustration for Sri Lanka's bowlers before he became Perera's fourth victim of the day. Jack Leach, batting on 14, then survived some anxious moments in the final two overs to give Foakes a chance to complete a momentous debut ton on day two. Sri Lanka's veteran spinner Rangana Herath claimed his 100th Test scalp at Galle after sending back England skipper Joe Root in the opening session. Only two other bowlers have achieved 100 Test wickets on one ground -- Herath's legendary compatriot Muttiah Muralitharan who achieved it at Galle, Kandy and SSC Colombo, and England paceman James Anderson at Lord's. Herath notched up the milestone when Root came down the wicket and missed after a breezy 35. Root had also steadied England when they stumbled to 10 for 2 after debutant opener Rory Burns was caught behind off Surange Lakmal for nine and Moeen Ali was bowled next ball. Surrey left-hander Burns had been given the tough task of replacing stalwart Alastair Cook following his retirement in September. After Root's dismissal, Perera skittled Keaton Jennings four short of his 50 before bowling Ben Stokes around his legs for seven as he attempted to sweep.",

            "desc": "A project that has forced Julia Roberts out of hermitage automatically raises expectations. But does her latest, Homecoming, which marks her debut in digital entertainment, live up to it? The 10-episode thriller on Amazon Prime, directed by Sam Esmail (of Mr Robot fame) and co-starring Bobby Cannavale, Stephan James and Shea Whigham, revolves around a small-town waitress Heidi Bergman (Roberts). Only Bergman was earlier a high-profile counsellor at Geist, a private company that along with producing washing powders and drain cleaners, also helps soldiers transition into civilian life. Bergman however, doesn't remember anything about her job. When a stray complaint against the company troubles calm waters, a cesspool of memories and betrayals get stirred up. If you judge by the standards of a thriller, Homecoming is a tad underwhelming. The suspense element works only at a tertiary level and if you are looking for a racy twister, you have hit the wrong button. What series writers Micah Bloomberg and Eli Horowitz do instead is focus on dystopic inner lives in a world where innocence, trust and honesty - qualities which are conventionally upheld as aspirational and commendable - are playthings in the hands of the powerful. In many ways in fact, the series, alternating between the past and the present, resonates Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot as an unseen, all-powerful and ruthless corporate god plays with his humans - and what makes them human - for unknowable ends. The primal emotion of the series is that of searing disconnect. As the principal characters skid around the play board of their lives trying to make sense of what had or is happening to them, almost all of them come across as islands tossing in the sea of humanity around them. They talk to each other and sometimes connect, but a sense of all-pervasive dissociation and disquiet is never too far. Whether it is Heidi Bergman who doesn't know who she is, the slick-tongued Colin Belfast (Cannavale) who seems to run the show, or the conscientious Thomas Carrasco (Whigham), a government employee who doggedly goes about his job knowing well he has very little actual agency - the characters exist in an emotional vacuum. I especially loved Esmail's construction of this alone-ness and loneliness on screen, done as much through meticulously fleshed out characters as clever camera work. Note the repeated top shots, always watching - like the third eye - as people go about their daily business in honeycomb-esque constructions. Homecoming also turns the lens on an increasingly scrutinising and de-humanising state. What is supposed to nurture and enrich takes on the guise of benevolence to squeeze out one's very life-force. Unquestioning conformation is the order of the day and if you resist, there are always the weapons of \"paranoia\" and \"mental imbalance\". In short, you either eat or be eaten - it's as simple as that. Rings some bells? As far as standout performances go, Roberts, with her listening face, is just right as Heidi Bergman. But does she leave you feeling wowed? Not really. She hits all the right notes but doesn't quite become superlative. It's rather Whigham who leaves a lasting impression as the conscientious man in a thankless job. Like Roberts, his is a listening character, but the intensity he brings to the table with very little weaponry is remarkable. All said and done, Homecoming is uneven with quite a few brilliantly crafted scenes that light up the mostly flat narrative. It doesn't blow you away. But it is its notes of poignancy that eventually nestle in an unsuspecting corner of your brain to pose some niggling questions.

As a part of the task, there were two tickets for each contestant who could them only once to enter either of the house once the gong rung. Once the contestants entered the house, they had to shred their tickets that was used by them. At the end of the task, the house with the least contestants would qualify for the captaincy task. As Srishty cannot compete for captaincy, she was the moderator of the task. Teams were formed and after meticulous calculations, strategies were made. The Happy Club - Somi, Romil, Surbhi and Deepak along with Sreesanth, Shivashish, Karanvir, Dipika, Jasleen, Rohit and Megha were the first ones to enter the other house. Facing defeat and being nominated for eliminations this week the Happy Club had vowed that they won't let the other contestants live in peace and will create havoc in their lives.

In a video put out by the Hockey India on its official Twitter account, Manpreet said, \"It is altogether a different vibe when you see the live match in a stadium. When the matches are telecast on television, you can only see a couple of angles and you may miss all the enthralling action. But when you see the action live in the stadium, the run and energy of players invigorates fun. It is proud feeling that India is hosting the Hockey World Cup. I would urge all people to buy tickets and watch matches in the stadium.\" Manpreet also feels that the team has to refine their approach in attack and defence before they begin their campaign. \"We had not lost a single match at the Asian Champions Trophy which gave a morale boost to the team. We have to work more on our attack and defence,\" he stated.

            "desc": "England's Ben Foakes made a memorable debut to help the tourists recover from a terrible start and reach 321 for eight wickets on the opening day of the first Test against Sri Lanka on Tuesday. With England reeling at 10 for two and then 103 for five, even the 200-mark looked difficult but Foakes forged 50-plus stands with Jos Buttler and Sam Curran to drag them back into the contest. Foakes, replacing the injured Jonny Bairstow in the side, was batting on 87 at stumps, having been impressive with his batting while his glovework remains to be seen. Jack Leach was on 14 at the other end after quite a turnaround by the tourists in the last two sessions. England had earlier made an unconvincing start to life following the retirement of stalwart Alastair Cook after captain Joe Root opted to bat first to avoid the prospect of having the final innings at a famously spin-friendly venue. It was the early pace of Suranga Lakmal, however, that undid the top order of a side playing their first Test without England great Cook who left the international arena in September. Opener Rory Burns (nine) disappointed on his Test debut and Moeen Ali failed to justify his promotion to number three as Lakmal claimed two wickets in two balls. Root denied Lakmal a hat-trick and started the rebuilding job, initially at a run-a-ball rate, with Keaton Jennings. Sri Lanka wasted both their reviews inside 12 overs but it was the golden arm of retiring 40-year-old Rangana Herath that ended Root's 62-run stand with Jennings. Herath, given a guard-of-honour by his team mates ahead of his 93rd and final Test, yorked an advancing Root to claim his 100th wicket at the venue where he made his Test debut in 1999. Root hit five boundaries in a fluent 35 before paying for his recklessness. Dilruwan Perera (4-70) dismissed Jennings for 46 and Ben Stokes for seven in his second spell, clean bowling both the left-handers. Buttler and Foakes sensibly abandoned the ultra-aggressive batting which had cost England dear in the morning session and combined in a 61-run stand for the sixth wicket. Even after Perera dismissed Buttler for 38, Foakes raised 88 runs with Curran, who hit three sixes before falling for 48, while Adil Rashid contributed a quickfire 35 down the order.",

            "desc": "On Tuesday, responding to rumours that he had 'disappeared' Tharoor, a couple of days after his comment on the Ram Mandir movement said he was feeling under the weather and in bed with a bad 'chest infection'. He wrote on Twitter: \"For all my hyper-imaginative friends reading political motives behind my \"disappearance\": I am in bed w/ a bad chest infection, on antibiotics, & have been advised a few days' complete rest. Have cancelled all functions for 3 days &am not taking calls. Pls don't listen to rumours.\" A couple of days ago, with the Ram Mandir movement gathering momentum, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has said no Hindu text condones the use of violence to get one's way and scriptures say people should build Ram in their hearts. \"In fact, if anything, there is a scripture that says build Ram in your heart. And if Ram is built in our heart it should little matter where else he is or he is not, because he is everywhere,\" Tharoor said in an exclusive interview to PTI. The Congress MP was responding to a question about his recent remark that no good Hindu would want a temple at the disputed Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site. Tharoor reiterated his point asking if a good Hindu would want to build a Ram Temple at the expense of an act of violence. \"My only point is, would a Hindu have wanted to build such a precious place at the expense of conducting an act of violence. A good Hindu is a law-abiding Hindu. A good Hindu is someone who has 'insaaniyat',\" the Congress leader asked. He went on to argue that while a good Hindu was also obviously somebody who worshipped and believed in his worship, Hindu scriptures do not allow the use of violence to have one's way. \"A good Hindu is also obviously somebody who worships and believes in his worship. But where have we been told in our Hindu texts and our Hindu teachings which, in fact since the days of Adi Shankaracharya, have emphasized much more on ahimsa. Where have we been told that we should conduct violence against other people to have our way,\" questioned Tharoor. The Lok Sabha MP from Thiruvananthapuram also wondered what about his remarks had \"shocked the BJP so much\". He said, \"Most good Hindus I know would want a Ram Temple at the place where they believe he was born. But most good Hindus would not have wanted it by demolishing other people's place of worship. And this is more or less what Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani also said.\" The Congress leader quoted Advani as having called the day of demolition of Babri Masjid as the \"saddest day of his life\". \"Advani said he would have respectfully wanted to relocate the site and Vajpayee had also hinted at all sorts of compromises provided the Ram Temple could also be built, it could even be a joint wall between a mosque and a temple. Who knows what Vajpayee would have wanted? He is not here to tell us but no, neither of them ever spoke in terms of demolishing the mosque and when it happened they both condemned it. So what am I saying that is so shocking for the BJP?\" asked Tharoor. On the perception that majority Hindus want a Ram Temple at the site where evidence also suggests that a temple existed, Tharoor said this was an academic argument. \"A temple really did exist. Whether it was the Ram Temple we don't know. Definitely there were pillars underneath. But given the experiences of that period so many temples were destroyed and mosques built in their places. I am not challenging the historical veracity of this belief, that debate is over. That's totally academic now,\" said the Congress MP. The Congress leader acknowledged that \"the important thing is that an overwhelming majority of Hindus particularly in north India believe this was where Lord Ram was born and where there should be a Mandir\", but went on to add, \"to my mind arguing that point is academic.\" He then asked if a Hindu would ever want to build such a precious place, a temple, at the expense of conducting an act of violence. To a pointed query on whether he personally wanted a Ram Temple at the stated site, Tharoor said, \"I have said as much as I wanted to say.\"",

            "desc": "Lara took to golf in 1994 after he beat Sir Garfield Sober's record of the highest Test knock and has won titles in the Caribbean. Moving or bouncing, a cricket ball was never a concern for Brian Lara but one of the most destructive batsmen ever ended up with a headache while trying to control \"silly little golf balls\". \"Yes, golf is a weird game. I was capable of dealing with moving and bouncing cricket balls, but this little silly ball, sitting on the ground, gave me quite a headache early on for few years, but taught me how to be disciplined in controlling the ball,\" Lara told PTI on Tuesday speaking about his love for the game. Lara took to golf in 1994 after he beat Sir Garfield Sober's record of the highest Test knock and has won titles in the Caribbean. Speaking about other cricketers, who have taken to golf, Lara said while Kapil Dev and Jacques Kallis' love for the sport is well known, former Australian captain Ricky Ponting is among the best. \"We have been hearing about Jacques Kallis and Kapil Dev, but the best that I have seen is Ricky Ponting. His putting is a little better and he is consistent on that front,\" he said. Lara also recalled an instance of playin alongside Kapil Dev in an American tournament. \"We were playing in a tournament in the US. I was up against an American amateur. He defeated me. After that I went up to Kapil and said, 'this American guy is unbelievable'. Kapil nodded funnily and went against him. He returned only to tell me he cleaned the American in 15 holes. That is Kapil, a proper golfer here,\" he said. Lara said he focused more on cricket than golf because he felt the game would affect his batting. \"Pretty early, when I started playing golf, I was compared to Garfield Sobers, who played both cricket and golf. In cricket, you should keep your wrist as straight as possible, unlike golf. \"This itself was a problem, and hence, I did not play much of golf in my playing days,\" said the legendary left-hander. There were not many left-handed golfers too. I did switch to play right-handed pretty soon, but did not felt comfortable because playing left-handed in cricket came naturally to me. This also made me focus not much on golf,\" he said.",

So it came as a surprise when the founder of Microsoft brandished a jar of human waste at a forum on the future of the toilet in Beijing on Tuesday. The stunt was an effort to draw attention to a problem affecting developing countries around the world: not enough toilets. \"In places without sanitation you have got way more than that,\" Gates said, pointing to the feces inside the clear canister resting on a table. \"And that's what kids when they are out playing, they are being exposed to all the time, and that's why we connect this not just with quality of life, but with disease and death and with malnutrition,\" he told attendees. The billionaire said more than half of the world's population suffers without clean, comfortable sanitation facilities. \"When you think of things that are basic right up there with health and enough to eat, you think that having a reasonable toilet certainly belongs on that list,\" Gates said. Gates has previously used shock tactics to draw attention to his disease-battling efforts. In 2009, he loosed mosquitoes at a Technology, Entertainment, Design (TED) Conference in California to make a point about the deadly sting of malaria - waiting a minute or so before assuring the audience the liberated insects were disease-free. Gates was in Beijing on Tuesday for the \"Reinvented Toilet Expo\", a forum hosted by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation showcasing various cutting edge toilet technology in lieu of sewers, making them easier and cheaper to install the devices. The world's number two economy is in the midst of a drive to improve its notoriously malodorous bathrooms, a campaign President Xi Jinping has dubbed the \"toilet revolution.\" \"China has made great progress in improving health and sanitation for millions of people,\" Gates said. \"China has an opportunity to launch a new category of innovated non-sewered sanitation solutions that will benefit millions of people worldwide.\" According to UNICEF, 892 million people worldwide have no choice but to defecate in the open. India's government says its public health drive has slashed the number of people in the country forced to defecate in the open from 550 million in 2014 to less than 150 million today.",

He will also be shown a video at the guest house within the temple premises to apprise him about the progress of the projects at the township, Singh said further. The foundation stone of Kedarpuri reconstruction projects was laid by Modi during his visit to the temple in 2017. Snowfall in the higher reaches of the mountains of Uttarakhand has enhanced the beauty of the temple and its surroundings. All preparations have been made in view of the prime minister's visit with the road from the helipad to the temple totally cleared of snow, Singh said. Several new features including a meditation cave 400 metres above Kedarnath will greet Modi during his visit this time. Built at a secluded spot 400 metres above the shrine, the cave will be shown to the prime minister from a distance as he is not scheduled to go there, Rudraprayag district magistrate Mangesh Ghildiyal said. Other new features for Modi to see at the shrine this time will be a much wider Mukhya Aksha, the passage from the point of confluence of Mandakini and Saraswati to the facade of the temple and the retaining walls constructed on the banks of the two rivers, the official said. Kedarpuri reconstruction has been on Modi's priority list and he keeps monitoring its progress on regular intervals via video conferencing.

Having showcased her work in fashion shows and exhibitions across the country, designer Shriya Bhupal in an exclusive chat with Pinkvilla, gave us some much-needed wedding outfit tips, about the latest trends and much more. Shriya also shared the inputs regarding the trousseau, and styles and silhouettes that are huge this season. Which are the colours that are raging super big this festive season? People, unfortunately, do not have the luxury of time off late, in this case, how can one put together a last-minute look? By mixing the styles and experimenting. Looking at a wardrobe full of clothes and yet having nothing to wear is a dilemma we all go through. The best scenario here would be to put together styles to create an entirely new outfit - saves you time + money. For someone who isn't purely desi, what should those guys opt for? The wedding season is just around the corner, so what are the hues that every bride must opt for? Destination weddings are the new in thing, so what should one carry to for the wedding without paying excess baggage? If you were attending your best friends wedding what would you wear for the haldi ceremony, sangeet and wedding? For the haldi, it would be a minimal ruffled lehenga in a pastel color because it's light & easy. For the Sangeet, my pick would be a heavily embellished lehenga topped with a fur cape. And for the wedding, I would pick a chiffon tie-up blouse and a floral embellished lehenga. It's modern, yet dramatic. One major no-no that a bride must never do on her big day? One trend which is way too passe? A matchy bride ie. lipstick being red outfit being red and red nails. It's way too overdone. Earlier this year, Shriya got married to Anindith Reddy in Hyderabad on July 6. The designer got married in a grand wedding in July attended by many renowned designers and celebrities from the film industry. Anindith is the eldest son of Vishweshwar Reddy, sitting MP of Chevella and one of the richest politicians in Telangana.",

Continuing the renaming spree that started with changing the name of Allahabad to Prayagraj, the UP CM said that the Faizabad district, of which Ayodhya city is a part, would be known by its \"original name\". Addressing a huge gathering comprising Hindu seers who chanted \"mandir ka nirman karo (build the temple,\" Adityanath also announced that his government will build an airport in Ayodhya and name it after Lord Ram and a medical college will be named after his father, Dashratha. \"We have come to assure you that no power can do injustice with Ayodhya. Every Indian knows what Ayodhya wants,\" he said, alluding to the construction of the Ram Mandir at the disputed Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi site. The CM's announcement, which he himself had described as \"good news\", is being largely seen as a Hindutva push by the BJP before next year's Lok Sabha elections. It comes amid a growing clamour from BJP leaders and members of Sangh outfits for the Centre to bring a law to facilitate the construction of Ram Temple, citing \"frustration\" in the delay in hearings in the Supreme Court. Responding to criticism of his renaming spree, he said a name holds a lot of significance in this country. \"Why are those protesting the change not named Raavan or Duryodhan? Why didn't their parents name them 'Raavan' and 'Duryodhan' in that case?\" he asked. The name change comes as members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas were raising demands that the sister towns of Faizabad and Ayodhya be merged and renamed \"Shri Ayodhya.\" \"The decision by the Yogi Adityanath government to change the name of Allahabad to Prayagraj is commendable. Our governments should keep in mind the sentiments of the people and also change the name of Faizabad to Shri Ayodhya,\" VHP spokesperson Sharad Sharma had said.

            "desc": "Ben Foakes hit a defiant and unbeaten 87 on debut to guide England to 321/8 -- after Sri Lanka claimed cheap early wickets -- at the end of the first day of the first Test. The Surrey wicket-keeper batsman, who knows this could just be a one-off chance as Jonny Bairstow regains fitness, came in with England precariously placed on 103 for five on a Galle pitch notorious for low scores. Foakes built crucial partnerships including an 88-run seventh wicket stand with Sam Curran, who made 48, to defy Sri Lanka's bowlers. England elected to bat first in what was Sri Lankan spin legend Rangana Herath's farewell match. The right-handed Foakes steadied the innings reaching his half-century early in the final session as the tourists lost just three wickets after lunch. Foakes put on 61 for the sixth wicket with Jos Buttler, who was eventually caught behind off Dilruwan Perera for 38. Left-hander Curran attacked the bowling, hitting one four and three sixes before falling two short of his fifty to spinner Akila Dananjaya. Adil Rashid made a useful 35 in a stand of 54 with Foakes that increased the frustration for Sri Lanka's bowlers before he became Perera's fourth victim of the day. Jack Leach, batting on 14, then survived some anxious moments in the final two overs to give Foakes a chance to complete a momentous debut ton on day two. Sri Lanka's veteran spinner Rangana Herath claimed his 100th Test scalp at Galle after sending back England skipper Joe Root in the opening session. Only two other bowlers have achieved 100 Test wickets on one ground -- Herath's legendary compatriot Muttiah Muralitharan who achieved it at Galle, Kandy and SSC Colombo, and England paceman James Anderson at Lord's. Herath notched up the milestone when Root came down the wicket and missed after a breezy 35. Root had also steadied England when they stumbled to 10 for 2 after debutant opener Rory Burns was caught behind off Surange Lakmal for nine and Moeen Ali was bowled next ball. Surrey left-hander Burns had been given the tough task of replacing stalwart Alastair Cook following his retirement in September. After Root's dismissal, Perera skittled Keaton Jennings four short of his 50 before bowling Ben Stokes around his legs for seven as he attempted to sweep.",

            "desc": "A project that has forced Julia Roberts out of hermitage automatically raises expectations. But does her latest, Homecoming, which marks her debut in digital entertainment, live up to it? The 10-episode thriller on Amazon Prime, directed by Sam Esmail (of Mr Robot fame) and co-starring Bobby Cannavale, Stephan James and Shea Whigham, revolves around a small-town waitress Heidi Bergman (Roberts). Only Bergman was earlier a high-profile counsellor at Geist, a private company that along with producing washing powders and drain cleaners, also helps soldiers transition into civilian life. Bergman however, doesn't remember anything about her job. When a stray complaint against the company troubles calm waters, a cesspool of memories and betrayals get stirred up. If you judge by the standards of a thriller, Homecoming is a tad underwhelming. The suspense element works only at a tertiary level and if you are looking for a racy twister, you have hit the wrong button. What series writers Micah Bloomberg and Eli Horowitz do instead is focus on dystopic inner lives in a world where innocence, trust and honesty - qualities which are conventionally upheld as aspirational and commendable - are playthings in the hands of the powerful. In many ways in fact, the series, alternating between the past and the present, resonates Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot as an unseen, all-powerful and ruthless corporate god plays with his humans - and what makes them human - for unknowable ends. The primal emotion of the series is that of searing disconnect. As the principal characters skid around the play board of their lives trying to make sense of what had or is happening to them, almost all of them come across as islands tossing in the sea of humanity around them. They talk to each other and sometimes connect, but a sense of all-pervasive dissociation and disquiet is never too far. Whether it is Heidi Bergman who doesn't know who she is, the slick-tongued Colin Belfast (Cannavale) who seems to run the show, or the conscientious Thomas Carrasco (Whigham), a government employee who doggedly goes about his job knowing well he has very little actual agency - the characters exist in an emotional vacuum. I especially loved Esmail's construction of this alone-ness and loneliness on screen, done as much through meticulously fleshed out characters as clever camera work. Note the repeated top shots, always watching - like the third eye - as people go about their daily business in honeycomb-esque constructions. Homecoming also turns the lens on an increasingly scrutinising and de-humanising state. What is supposed to nurture and enrich takes on the guise of benevolence to squeeze out one's very life-force. Unquestioning conformation is the order of the day and if you resist, there are always the weapons of \"paranoia\" and \"mental imbalance\". In short, you either eat or be eaten - it's as simple as that. Rings some bells? As far as standout performances go, Roberts, with her listening face, is just right as Heidi Bergman. But does she leave you feeling wowed? Not really. She hits all the right notes but doesn't quite become superlative. It's rather Whigham who leaves a lasting impression as the conscientious man in a thankless job. Like Roberts, his is a listening character, but the intensity he brings to the table with very little weaponry is remarkable. All said and done, Homecoming is uneven with quite a few brilliantly crafted scenes that light up the mostly flat narrative. It doesn't blow you away. But it is its notes of poignancy that eventually nestle in an unsuspecting corner of your brain to pose some niggling questions.

            "desc": "If there is an international cricket match in India, the spectators will automatically throng the stadiums and if you are an ardent cricket fan, you might just get lucky to get a ticket after standing in long queues. But it may not be the case with other sports. Just five months ago, Indian football skipper and one of the best football players of India, Sunil Chhetri made a heartfelt plea to the country to watch matches in the stadium and support the Indian team. On the same lines, India's hockey captain Manpreet Singh, who will lead India in the upcoming Odisha Hockey Men's World Cup, also urged the avid hockey buffs to watch the matches in the stadium instead of sitting in their homes. In a video put out by the Hockey India on its official Twitter account, Manpreet said, \"It is altogether a different vibe when you see the live match in a stadium. When the matches are telecast on television, you can only see a couple of angles and you may miss all the enthralling action. But when you see the action live in the stadium, the run and energy of players invigorates fun. It is proud feeling that India is hosting the Hockey World Cup. I would urge all people to buy tickets and watch matches in the stadium.\" Manpreet also feels that the team has to refine their approach in attack and defence before they begin their campaign. \"We had not lost a single match at the Asian Champions Trophy which gave a morale boost to the team. We have to work more on our attack and defence,\" he stated. Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik also launched a technology-driven and citizen-friendly MoBus service in capital Bhubaneswar ahead of the World Cup. A cycling tour headed by the mascot 'Olly' to promote the World Cup has also reached the Ansuman Memorial cricket tournament in Jajpur district.",

            "desc": "Congress MLA Krishna Chandra Sagaria on Tuesday resigned as member of the Odisha Assembly, protesting \"injustice\" meted out to an alleged gangrape victim of Koraput district, who committed suicide earlier this year. A 14-year-old girl in Kunduli area of Koraput district had alleged that she was gangraped by four men in uniform in October, last year. The police, however, ruled out rape, citing her medical reports. The girl subsequently committed suicide by hanging on January 22, triggering sharp reactions from many quarters. Stating that he had announced his decision to quit as a legislator on October 30, Sagaria, who represented Koraput assembly segment, said he met Assembly Speaker P K Amat on Tuesday morning and submitted his resignation letter. \"I have quit the membership of Odisha Assembly, as I feel I have no moral right to continue as an MLA, having failed to ensure justice in Kunduli gangrape and suicide incident,\" the Congress leader told reporters. Sagaria also said that the speaker hasn't reacted to his move as yet. The Dalit leader, however, clarified he would continue to work for the Congress. He said he was deeply pained to have learned about the fate of the 14-year-old Kunduli girl, earlier this year. \"Being the local representative, I was morally responsible to ensure justice for her,\" he noted. Holding the BJD-led state government responsible for the incident, the Congress leader had earlier alleged that the investigation was \"hushed up\" by the police. He vowed to reach out to the people of Odisha to generate create awareness about the \"increasing atrocities and crimes against women\" in the state. \"I will tell people about the inaction on the part of the state government in providing justice and security to women,\" he had said.",

            "desc": "England's Ben Foakes made a memorable debut to help the tourists recover from a terrible start and reach 321 for eight wickets on the opening day of the first Test against Sri Lanka on Tuesday. With England reeling at 10 for two and then 103 for five, even the 200-mark looked difficult but Foakes forged 50-plus stands with Jos Buttler and Sam Curran to drag them back into the contest. Foakes, replacing the injured Jonny Bairstow in the side, was batting on 87 at stumps, having been impressive with his batting while his glovework remains to be seen. Jack Leach was on 14 at the other end after quite a turnaround by the tourists in the last two sessions. England had earlier made an unconvincing start to life following the retirement of stalwart Alastair Cook after captain Joe Root opted to bat first to avoid the prospect of having the final innings at a famously spin-friendly venue. It was the early pace of Suranga Lakmal, however, that undid the top order of a side playing their first Test without England great Cook who left the international arena in September. Opener Rory Burns (nine) disappointed on his Test debut and Moeen Ali failed to justify his promotion to number three as Lakmal claimed two wickets in two balls. Root denied Lakmal a hat-trick and started the rebuilding job, initially at a run-a-ball rate, with Keaton Jennings. Sri Lanka wasted both their reviews inside 12 overs but it was the golden arm of retiring 40-year-old Rangana Herath that ended Root's 62-run stand with Jennings. Herath, given a guard-of-honour by his team mates ahead of his 93rd and final Test, yorked an advancing Root to claim his 100th wicket at the venue where he made his Test debut in 1999. Root hit five boundaries in a fluent 35 before paying for his recklessness. Dilruwan Perera (4-70) dismissed Jennings for 46 and Ben Stokes for seven in his second spell, clean bowling both the left-handers. Buttler and Foakes sensibly abandoned the ultra-aggressive batting which had cost England dear in the morning session and combined in a 61-run stand for the sixth wicket. Even after Perera dismissed Buttler for 38, Foakes raised 88 runs with Curran, who hit three sixes before falling for 48, while Adil Rashid contributed a quickfire 35 down the order.",

            "desc": "On Tuesday, responding to rumours that he had 'disappeared' Tharoor, a couple of days after his comment on the Ram Mandir movement said he was feeling under the weather and in bed with a bad 'chest infection'. He wrote on Twitter: \"For all my hyper-imaginative friends reading political motives behind my \"disappearance\": I am in bed w/ a bad chest infection, on antibiotics, & have been advised a few days' complete rest. Have cancelled all functions for 3 days &am not taking calls. Pls don't listen to rumours.\" A couple of days ago, with the Ram Mandir movement gathering momentum, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has said no Hindu text condones the use of violence to get one's way and scriptures say people should build Ram in their hearts. \"In fact, if anything, there is a scripture that says build Ram in your heart. And if Ram is built in our heart it should little matter where else he is or he is not, because he is everywhere,\" Tharoor said in an exclusive interview to PTI. The Congress MP was responding to a question about his recent remark that no good Hindu would want a temple at the disputed Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site. Tharoor reiterated his point asking if a good Hindu would want to build a Ram Temple at the expense of an act of violence. \"My only point is, would a Hindu have wanted to build such a precious place at the expense of conducting an act of violence. A good Hindu is a law-abiding Hindu. A good Hindu is someone who has 'insaaniyat',\" the Congress leader asked. He went on to argue that while a good Hindu was also obviously somebody who worshipped and believed in his worship, Hindu scriptures do not allow the use of violence to have one's way. \"A good Hindu is also obviously somebody who worships and believes in his worship. But where have we been told in our Hindu texts and our Hindu teachings which, in fact since the days of Adi Shankaracharya, have emphasized much more on ahimsa. Where have we been told that we should conduct violence against other people to have our way,\" questioned Tharoor. The Lok Sabha MP from Thiruvananthapuram also wondered what about his remarks had \"shocked the BJP so much\". He said, \"Most good Hindus I know would want a Ram Temple at the place where they believe he was born. But most good Hindus would not have wanted it by demolishing other people's place of worship. And this is more or less what Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani also said.\" The Congress leader quoted Advani as having called the day of demolition of Babri Masjid as the \"saddest day of his life\". \"Advani said he would have respectfully wanted to relocate the site and Vajpayee had also hinted at all sorts of compromises provided the Ram Temple could also be built, it could even be a joint wall between a mosque and a temple. Who knows what Vajpayee would have wanted? He is not here to tell us but no, neither of them ever spoke in terms of demolishing the mosque and when it happened they both condemned it. So what am I saying that is so shocking for the BJP?\" asked Tharoor. On the perception that majority Hindus want a Ram Temple at the site where evidence also suggests that a temple existed, Tharoor said this was an academic argument. \"A temple really did exist. Whether it was the Ram Temple we don't know. Definitely there were pillars underneath. But given the experiences of that period so many temples were destroyed and mosques built in their places. I am not challenging the historical veracity of this belief, that debate is over. That's totally academic now,\" said the Congress MP. The Congress leader acknowledged that \"the important thing is that an overwhelming majority of Hindus particularly in north India believe this was where Lord Ram was born and where there should be a Mandir\", but went on to add, \"to my mind arguing that point is academic.\" He then asked if a Hindu would ever want to build such a precious place, a temple, at the expense of conducting an act of violence. To a pointed query on whether he personally wanted a Ram Temple at the stated site, Tharoor said, \"I have said as much as I wanted to say.\"",

Moving or bouncing, a cricket ball was never a concern for Brian Lara but one of the most destructive batsmen ever ended up with a headache while trying to control \"silly little golf balls\". \"Yes, golf is a weird game. I was capable of dealing with moving and bouncing cricket balls, but this little silly ball, sitting on the ground, gave me quite a headache early on for few years, but taught me how to be disciplined in controlling the ball,\" Lara told PTI on Tuesday speaking about his love for the game. Lara took to golf in 1994 after he beat Sir Garfield Sober's record of the highest Test knock and has won titles in the Caribbean. Speaking about other cricketers, who have taken to golf, Lara said while Kapil Dev and Jacques Kallis' love for the sport is well known, former Australian captain Ricky Ponting is among the best. \"We have been hearing about Jacques Kallis and Kapil Dev, but the best that I have seen is Ricky Ponting. His putting is a little better and he is consistent on that front,\" he said. Lara also recalled an instance of playin alongside Kapil Dev in an American tournament. \"We were playing in a tournament in the US. I was up against an American amateur. He defeated me. After that I went up to Kapil and said, 'this American guy is unbelievable'. Kapil nodded funnily and went against him. He returned only to tell me he cleaned the American in 15 holes. That is Kapil, a proper golfer here,\" he said. Lara said he focused more on cricket than golf because he felt the game would affect his batting. \"Pretty early, when I started playing golf, I was compared to Garfield Sobers, who played both cricket and golf. In cricket, you should keep your wrist as straight as possible, unlike golf. \"This itself was a problem, and hence, I did not play much of golf in my playing days,\" said the legendary left-hander. There were not many left-handed golfers too. I did switch to play right-handed pretty soon, but did not felt comfortable because playing left-handed in cricket came naturally to me. This also made me focus not much on golf,\" he said.",

So it came as a surprise when the founder of Microsoft brandished a jar of human waste at a forum on the future of the toilet in Beijing on Tuesday. The stunt was an effort to draw attention to a problem affecting developing countries around the world: not enough toilets. \"In places without sanitation you have got way more than that,\" Gates said, pointing to the feces inside the clear canister resting on a table. \"And that's what kids when they are out playing, they are being exposed to all the time, and that's why we connect this not just with quality of life, but with disease and death and with malnutrition,\" he told attendees. The billionaire said more than half of the world's population suffers without clean, comfortable sanitation facilities. \"When you think of things that are basic right up there with health and enough to eat, you think that having a reasonable toilet certainly belongs on that list,\" Gates said. Gates has previously used shock tactics to draw attention to his disease-battling efforts. In 2009, he loosed mosquitoes at a Technology, Entertainment, Design (TED) Conference in California to make a point about the deadly sting of malaria - waiting a minute or so before assuring the audience the liberated insects were disease-free. Gates was in Beijing on Tuesday for the \"Reinvented Toilet Expo\", a forum hosted by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation showcasing various cutting edge toilet technology in lieu of sewers, making them easier and cheaper to install the devices. The world's number two economy is in the midst of a drive to improve its notoriously malodorous bathrooms, a campaign President Xi Jinping has dubbed the \"toilet revolution.\" \"China has made great progress in improving health and sanitation for millions of people,\" Gates said. \"China has an opportunity to launch a new category of innovated non-sewered sanitation solutions that will benefit millions of people worldwide.\" According to UNICEF, 892 million people worldwide have no choice but to defecate in the open. India's government says its public health drive has slashed the number of people in the country forced to defecate in the open from 550 million in 2014 to less than 150 million today.",

Having showcased her work in fashion shows and exhibitions across the country, designer Shriya Bhupal in an exclusive chat with Pinkvilla, gave us some much-needed wedding outfit tips, about the latest trends and much more. Shriya also shared the inputs regarding the trousseau, and styles and silhouettes that are huge this season. Which are the colours that are raging super big this festive season? People, unfortunately, do not have the luxury of time off late, in this case, how can one put together a last-minute look? By mixing the styles and experimenting. Looking at a wardrobe full of clothes and yet having nothing to wear is a dilemma we all go through. The best scenario here would be to put together styles to create an entirely new outfit - saves you time + money. For someone who isn't purely desi, what should those guys opt for? The wedding season is just around the corner, so what are the hues that every bride must opt for? Destination weddings are the new in thing, so what should one carry to for the wedding without paying excess baggage? If you were attending your best friends wedding what would you wear for the haldi ceremony, sangeet and wedding? For the haldi, it would be a minimal ruffled lehenga in a pastel color because it's light & easy. For the Sangeet, my pick would be a heavily embellished lehenga topped with a fur cape. And for the wedding, I would pick a chiffon tie-up blouse and a floral embellished lehenga. It's modern, yet dramatic. One major no-no that a bride must never do on her big day? One trend which is way too passe? A matchy bride ie. lipstick being red outfit being red and red nails. It's way too overdone. Earlier this year, Shriya got married to Anindith Reddy in Hyderabad on July 6. The designer got married in a grand wedding in July attended by many renowned designers and celebrities from the film industry. Anindith is the eldest son of Vishweshwar Reddy, sitting MP of Chevella and one of the richest politicians in Telangana.",

Today, the paparazzi snapped both Taimur and Inaaya enjoying their playtime together. Taimur, who has become paparazzi's favourite was seen waving and talking to them while the photogs clicked him. Baby Tim looked cute as a button wearing a blue striped T-Shirt and blue denim shorts with a pair of blue sneakers. On the other hand, Inaaya was seen nestled in the arms of her nanny wearing a collared floral printed frock, white shoes and bow-style headband. Check out the adorable photos of Taimur and Inaaya below and tell us about it in the comments section. Recently, reports suggested that Saif Ali Khan and Kareena wanted to keep Taimur away from the shutterbugs for now. But, Saif dismissed the rumours stating that these speculations were false. Meanwhile, in an EXCLUSIVE interview with Pinkvilla, Saif spoke candidly to us about how Taimur has changed Saifeena's life. \"Our timings have changed. We've become more responsible. We sleep earlier. We wake up earlier because he is up at the crack of dawn. Your mental timetable is more based around him than around yourself. And that's a welcome change. I like a bit more stable routine and he is helping me do that. I'm very happy about it!,\" Saif gushed about Taimur.",

            "desc": "Ayodhya: Faizabad district will be renamed as Sri Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced on Tuesday but remained silent on the construction of the Ram Temple in a Diwali speech from the holy city revered by millions of Hindus as the birthplace of Lord Ram. Continuing the renaming spree that started with changing the name of Allahabad to Prayagraj, the UP CM said that the Faizabad district, of which Ayodhya city is a part, would be known by its \"original name\". Addressing a huge gathering comprising Hindu seers who chanted \"mandir ka nirman karo (build the temple,\" Adityanath also announced that his government will build an airport in Ayodhya and name it after Lord Ram and a medical college will be named after his father, Dashratha. \"We have come to assure you that no power can do injustice with Ayodhya. Every Indian knows what Ayodhya wants,\" he said, alluding to the construction of the Ram Mandir at the disputed Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi site. The CM's announcement, which he himself had described as \"good news\", is being largely seen as a Hindutva push by the BJP before next year's Lok Sabha elections. It comes amid a growing clamour from BJP leaders and members of Sangh outfits for the Centre to bring a law to facilitate the construction of Ram Temple, citing \"frustration\" in the delay in hearings in the Supreme Court. Responding to criticism of his renaming spree, he said a name holds a lot of significance in this country. \"Why are those protesting the change not named Raavan or Duryodhan? Why didn't their parents name them 'Raavan' and 'Duryodhan' in that case?\" he asked. The name change comes as members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas were raising demands that the sister towns of Faizabad and Ayodhya be merged and renamed \"Shri Ayodhya.\" \"The decision by the Yogi Adityanath government to change the name of Allahabad to Prayagraj is commendable. Our governments should keep in mind the sentiments of the people and also change the name of Faizabad to Shri Ayodhya,\" VHP spokesperson Sharad Sharma had said. The BJP government had earlier renamed two railway stations - one near Agra which was called Farah and another that used to be known as Mughalsarai junction - after the party ideologue Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya.",

            "desc": "Ben Foakes hit a defiant and unbeaten 87 on debut to guide England to 321/8 -- after Sri Lanka claimed cheap early wickets -- at the end of the first day of the first Test. The Surrey wicket-keeper batsman, who knows this could just be a one-off chance as Jonny Bairstow regains fitness, came in with England precariously placed on 103 for five on a Galle pitch notorious for low scores. Foakes built crucial partnerships including an 88-run seventh wicket stand with Sam Curran, who made 48, to defy Sri Lanka's bowlers. England elected to bat first in what was Sri Lankan spin legend Rangana Herath's farewell match. The right-handed Foakes steadied the innings reaching his half-century early in the final session as the tourists lost just three wickets after lunch. Foakes put on 61 for the sixth wicket with Jos Buttler, who was eventually caught behind off Dilruwan Perera for 38. Left-hander Curran attacked the bowling, hitting one four and three sixes before falling two short of his fifty to spinner Akila Dananjaya. Adil Rashid made a useful 35 in a stand of 54 with Foakes that increased the frustration for Sri Lanka's bowlers before he became Perera's fourth victim of the day. Jack Leach, batting on 14, then survived some anxious moments in the final two overs to give Foakes a chance to complete a momentous debut ton on day two. Sri Lanka's veteran spinner Rangana Herath claimed his 100th Test scalp at Galle after sending back England skipper Joe Root in the opening session. Only two other bowlers have achieved 100 Test wickets on one ground -- Herath's legendary compatriot Muttiah Muralitharan who achieved it at Galle, Kandy and SSC Colombo, and England paceman James Anderson at Lord's. Herath notched up the milestone when Root came down the wicket and missed after a breezy 35. Root had also steadied England when they stumbled to 10 for 2 after debutant opener Rory Burns was caught behind off Surange Lakmal for nine and Moeen Ali was bowled next ball. Surrey left-hander Burns had been given the tough task of replacing stalwart Alastair Cook following his retirement in September. After Root's dismissal, Perera skittled Keaton Jennings four short of his 50 before bowling Ben Stokes around his legs for seven as he attempted to sweep.",

            "desc": "A project that has forced Julia Roberts out of hermitage automatically raises expectations. But does her latest, Homecoming, which marks her debut in digital entertainment, live up to it? The 10-episode thriller on Amazon Prime, directed by Sam Esmail (of Mr Robot fame) and co-starring Bobby Cannavale, Stephan James and Shea Whigham, revolves around a small-town waitress Heidi Bergman (Roberts). Only Bergman was earlier a high-profile counsellor at Geist, a private company that along with producing washing powders and drain cleaners, also helps soldiers transition into civilian life. Bergman however, doesn't remember anything about her job. When a stray complaint against the company troubles calm waters, a cesspool of memories and betrayals get stirred up. If you judge by the standards of a thriller, Homecoming is a tad underwhelming. The suspense element works only at a tertiary level and if you are looking for a racy twister, you have hit the wrong button. What series writers Micah Bloomberg and Eli Horowitz do instead is focus on dystopic inner lives in a world where innocence, trust and honesty - qualities which are conventionally upheld as aspirational and commendable - are playthings in the hands of the powerful. In many ways in fact, the series, alternating between the past and the present, resonates Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot as an unseen, all-powerful and ruthless corporate god plays with his humans - and what makes them human - for unknowable ends. The primal emotion of the series is that of searing disconnect. As the principal characters skid around the play board of their lives trying to make sense of what had or is happening to them, almost all of them come across as islands tossing in the sea of humanity around them. They talk to each other and sometimes connect, but a sense of all-pervasive dissociation and disquiet is never too far. Whether it is Heidi Bergman who doesn't know who she is, the slick-tongued Colin Belfast (Cannavale) who seems to run the show, or the conscientious Thomas Carrasco (Whigham), a government employee who doggedly goes about his job knowing well he has very little actual agency - the characters exist in an emotional vacuum. I especially loved Esmail's construction of this alone-ness and loneliness on screen, done as much through meticulously fleshed out characters as clever camera work. Note the repeated top shots, always watching - like the third eye - as people go about their daily business in honeycomb-esque constructions. Homecoming also turns the lens on an increasingly scrutinising and de-humanising state. What is supposed to nurture and enrich takes on the guise of benevolence to squeeze out one's very life-force. Unquestioning conformation is the order of the day and if you resist, there are always the weapons of \"paranoia\" and \"mental imbalance\". In short, you either eat or be eaten - it's as simple as that. Rings some bells? As far as standout performances go, Roberts, with her listening face, is just right as Heidi Bergman. But does she leave you feeling wowed? Not really. She hits all the right notes but doesn't quite become superlative. It's rather Whigham who leaves a lasting impression as the conscientious man in a thankless job. Like Roberts, his is a listening character, but the intensity he brings to the table with very little weaponry is remarkable. All said and done, Homecoming is uneven with quite a few brilliantly crafted scenes that light up the mostly flat narrative. It doesn't blow you away. But it is its notes of poignancy that eventually nestle in an unsuspecting corner of your brain to pose some niggling questions.

As the Captain is bestowed with special powers and the authority over all the housemates for the week, no one wants to abstain themselves from this opportunity. This week an interesting luxury budget task 'Yaha Waha' was announced. Creating two different setups, there was another dilapidated house created in the garden area. As a part of the task, there were two tickets for each contestant who could them only once to enter either of the house once the gong rung. Once the contestants entered the house, they had to shred their tickets that was used by them. At the end of the task, the house with the least contestants would qualify for the captaincy task. As Srishty cannot compete for captaincy, she was the moderator of the task. Teams were formed and after meticulous calculations, strategies were made. The Happy Club - Somi, Romil, Surbhi and Deepak along with Sreesanth, Shivashish, Karanvir, Dipika, Jasleen, Rohit and Megha were the first ones to enter the other house. Facing defeat and being nominated for eliminations this week the Happy Club had vowed that they won't let the other contestants live in peace and will create havoc in their lives.

In a video put out by the Hockey India on its official Twitter account, Manpreet said, \"It is altogether a different vibe when you see the live match in a stadium. When the matches are telecast on television, you can only see a couple of angles and you may miss all the enthralling action. But when you see the action live in the stadium, the run and energy of players invigorates fun. It is proud feeling that India is hosting the Hockey World Cup. I would urge all people to buy tickets and watch matches in the stadium.\" Manpreet also feels that the team has to refine their approach in attack and defence before they begin their campaign. \"We had not lost a single match at the Asian Champions Trophy which gave a morale boost to the team. We have to work more on our attack and defence,\" he stated. Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik also launched a technology-driven and citizen-friendly MoBus service in capital Bhubaneswar ahead of the World Cup.

            "desc": "England's Ben Foakes made a memorable debut to help the tourists recover from a terrible start and reach 321 for eight wickets on the opening day of the first Test against Sri Lanka on Tuesday. With England reeling at 10 for two and then 103 for five, even the 200-mark looked difficult but Foakes forged 50-plus stands with Jos Buttler and Sam Curran to drag them back into the contest. Foakes, replacing the injured Jonny Bairstow in the side, was batting on 87 at stumps, having been impressive with his batting while his glovework remains to be seen. Jack Leach was on 14 at the other end after quite a turnaround by the tourists in the last two sessions. England had earlier made an unconvincing start to life following the retirement of stalwart Alastair Cook after captain Joe Root opted to bat first to avoid the prospect of having the final innings at a famously spin-friendly venue. It was the early pace of Suranga Lakmal, however, that undid the top order of a side playing their first Test without England great Cook who left the international arena in September. Opener Rory Burns (nine) disappointed on his Test debut and Moeen Ali failed to justify his promotion to number three as Lakmal claimed two wickets in two balls. Root denied Lakmal a hat-trick and started the rebuilding job, initially at a run-a-ball rate, with Keaton Jennings. Sri Lanka wasted both their reviews inside 12 overs but it was the golden arm of retiring 40-year-old Rangana Herath that ended Root's 62-run stand with Jennings. Herath, given a guard-of-honour by his team mates ahead of his 93rd and final Test, yorked an advancing Root to claim his 100th wicket at the venue where he made his Test debut in 1999. Root hit five boundaries in a fluent 35 before paying for his recklessness. Dilruwan Perera (4-70) dismissed Jennings for 46 and Ben Stokes for seven in his second spell, clean bowling both the left-handers. Buttler and Foakes sensibly abandoned the ultra-aggressive batting which had cost England dear in the morning session and combined in a 61-run stand for the sixth wicket. Even after Perera dismissed Buttler for 38, Foakes raised 88 runs with Curran, who hit three sixes before falling for 48, while Adil Rashid contributed a quickfire 35 down the order.",

            "desc": "On Tuesday, responding to rumours that he had 'disappeared' Tharoor, a couple of days after his comment on the Ram Mandir movement said he was feeling under the weather and in bed with a bad 'chest infection'. He wrote on Twitter: \"For all my hyper-imaginative friends reading political motives behind my \"disappearance\": I am in bed w/ a bad chest infection, on antibiotics, & have been advised a few days' complete rest. Have cancelled all functions for 3 days &am not taking calls. Pls don't listen to rumours.\" A couple of days ago, with the Ram Mandir movement gathering momentum, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has said no Hindu text condones the use of violence to get one's way and scriptures say people should build Ram in their hearts. \"In fact, if anything, there is a scripture that says build Ram in your heart. And if Ram is built in our heart it should little matter where else he is or he is not, because he is everywhere,\" Tharoor said in an exclusive interview to PTI. The Congress MP was responding to a question about his recent remark that no good Hindu would want a temple at the disputed Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site. Tharoor reiterated his point asking if a good Hindu would want to build a Ram Temple at the expense of an act of violence. \"My only point is, would a Hindu have wanted to build such a precious place at the expense of conducting an act of violence. A good Hindu is a law-abiding Hindu. A good Hindu is someone who has 'insaaniyat',\" the Congress leader asked. He went on to argue that while a good Hindu was also obviously somebody who worshipped and believed in his worship, Hindu scriptures do not allow the use of violence to have one's way. \"A good Hindu is also obviously somebody who worships and believes in his worship. But where have we been told in our Hindu texts and our Hindu teachings which, in fact since the days of Adi Shankaracharya, have emphasized much more on ahimsa. Where have we been told that we should conduct violence against other people to have our way,\" questioned Tharoor. The Lok Sabha MP from Thiruvananthapuram also wondered what about his remarks had \"shocked the BJP so much\". He said, \"Most good Hindus I know would want a Ram Temple at the place where they believe he was born. But most good Hindus would not have wanted it by demolishing other people's place of worship. And this is more or less what Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani also said.\" The Congress leader quoted Advani as having called the day of demolition of Babri Masjid as the \"saddest day of his life\". \"Advani said he would have respectfully wanted to relocate the site and Vajpayee had also hinted at all sorts of compromises provided the Ram Temple could also be built, it could even be a joint wall between a mosque and a temple. Who knows what Vajpayee would have wanted? He is not here to tell us but no, neither of them ever spoke in terms of demolishing the mosque and when it happened they both condemned it. So what am I saying that is so shocking for the BJP?\" asked Tharoor. On the perception that majority Hindus want a Ram Temple at the site where evidence also suggests that a temple existed, Tharoor said this was an academic argument. \"A temple really did exist. Whether it was the Ram Temple we don't know. Definitely there were pillars underneath. But given the experiences of that period so many temples were destroyed and mosques built in their places. I am not challenging the historical veracity of this belief, that debate is over. That's totally academic now,\" said the Congress MP. The Congress leader acknowledged that \"the important thing is that an overwhelming majority of Hindus particularly in north India believe this was where Lord Ram was born and where there should be a Mandir\", but went on to add, \"to my mind arguing that point is academic.\" He then asked if a Hindu would ever want to build such a precious place, a temple, at the expense of conducting an act of violence. To a pointed query on whether he personally wanted a Ram Temple at the stated site, Tharoor said, \"I have said as much as I wanted to say.\"",

Lara took to golf in 1994 after he beat Sir Garfield Sober's record of the highest Test knock and has won titles in the Caribbean. Speaking about other cricketers, who have taken to golf, Lara said while Kapil Dev and Jacques Kallis' love for the sport is well known, former Australian captain Ricky Ponting is among the best. \"We have been hearing about Jacques Kallis and Kapil Dev, but the best that I have seen is Ricky Ponting. His putting is a little better and he is consistent on that front,\" he said. Lara also recalled an instance of playin alongside Kapil Dev in an American tournament. \"We were playing in a tournament in the US. I was up against an American amateur. He defeated me. After that I went up to Kapil and said, 'this American guy is unbelievable'. Kapil nodded funnily and went against him. He returned only to tell me he cleaned the American in 15 holes. That is Kapil, a proper golfer here,\" he said. Lara said he focused more on cricket than golf because he felt the game would affect his batting. \"Pretty early, when I started playing golf, I was compared to Garfield Sobers, who played both cricket and golf. In cricket, you should keep your wrist as straight as possible, unlike golf. \"This itself was a problem, and hence, I did not play much of golf in my playing days,\" said the legendary left-hander. There were not many left-handed golfers too. I did switch to play right-handed pretty soon, but did not felt comfortable because playing left-handed in cricket came naturally to me. This also made me focus not much on golf,\" he said.",

            "desc": "Beijing: As one of the world's richest men and most active philanthropists, Bill Gates usually has his hands full. Just not with poop. So it came as a surprise when the founder of Microsoft brandished a jar of human waste at a forum on the future of the toilet in Beijing on Tuesday. The stunt was an effort to draw attention to a problem affecting developing countries around the world: not enough toilets. \"In places without sanitation you have got way more than that,\" Gates said, pointing to the feces inside the clear canister resting on a table. \"And that's what kids when they are out playing, they are being exposed to all the time, and that's why we connect this not just with quality of life, but with disease and death and with malnutrition,\" he told attendees. The billionaire said more than half of the world's population suffers without clean, comfortable sanitation facilities. \"When you think of things that are basic right up there with health and enough to eat, you think that having a reasonable toilet certainly belongs on that list,\" Gates said. Gates has previously used shock tactics to draw attention to his disease-battling efforts. In 2009, he loosed mosquitoes at a Technology, Entertainment, Design (TED) Conference in California to make a point about the deadly sting of malaria - waiting a minute or so before assuring the audience the liberated insects were disease-free. Gates was in Beijing on Tuesday for the \"Reinvented Toilet Expo\", a forum hosted by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation showcasing various cutting edge toilet technology in lieu of sewers, making them easier and cheaper to install the devices. The world's number two economy is in the midst of a drive to improve its notoriously malodorous bathrooms, a campaign President Xi Jinping has dubbed the \"toilet revolution.\" \"China has made great progress in improving health and sanitation for millions of people,\" Gates said. \"China has an opportunity to launch a new category of innovated non-sewered sanitation solutions that will benefit millions of people worldwide.\" According to UNICEF, 892 million people worldwide have no choice but to defecate in the open. India's government says its public health drive has slashed the number of people in the country forced to defecate in the open from 550 million in 2014 to less than 150 million today.",

Narayana R (65) was attacked using sticks and stones by a group while he was going on his two-wheeler near an agricultural field in Sultanpur village this morning resulting in his death. Preliminary investigation revealed that Narayana's driver Mallaiah had allegedly spoken ill of a woman in the village and subsequently her family members locked Mallaiah up in his house Monday and 'attacked and killed' Narayana this morning, they said. Additional forces have been deployed in the village and the situation is under control and peaceful, Vikarabad District Superintendent of Police T Annapurna told news agency PTI. A case of murder and rioting under relevant IPC sections was registered based on a complaint filed by the deceased's son and some suspects have been picked up for questioning, the official said. The motive behind the murder seems to be Mallaiah talking ill about the woman. However, we are verifying political angle as well, the official added.",

As the Captain is bestowed with special powers and the authority over all the housemates for the week, no one wants to abstain themselves from this opportunity. This week an interesting luxury budget task 'Yaha Waha' was announced. Creating two different setups, there was another dilapidated house created in the garden area. As a part of the task, there were two tickets for each contestant who could them only once to enter either of the house once the gong rung. Once the contestants entered the house, they had to shred their tickets that was used by them. At the end of the task, the house with the least contestants would qualify for the captaincy task. As Srishty cannot compete for captaincy, she was the moderator of the task. Teams were formed and after meticulous calculations, strategies were made. The Happy Club - Somi, Romil, Surbhi and Deepak along with Sreesanth, Shivashish, Karanvir, Dipika, Jasleen, Rohit and Megha were the first ones to enter the other house. Facing defeat and being nominated for eliminations this week the Happy Club had vowed that they won't let the other contestants live in peace and will create havoc in their lives. Their first target was Sreesanth, and Surbhi and Deepak started instigating him hoping for reactions. Will Sreesanth be able to maintain his calm and win this task or will he let go? Will the contestants play the game smartly",

The prime minister will arrive at around 9.45 am, Chief Secretary Utpal Kumar Singh said, adding that after offering prayers at the temple, Modi will inspect the reconstruction projects underway at Kedarpuri. He will also be shown a video at the guest house within the temple premises to apprise him about the progress of the projects at the township, Singh said further. The foundation stone of Kedarpuri reconstruction projects was laid by Modi during his visit to the temple in 2017. Snowfall in the higher reaches of the mountains of Uttarakhand has enhanced the beauty of the temple and its surroundings. All preparations have been made in view of the prime minister's visit with the road from the helipad to the temple totally cleared of snow, Singh said. Several new features including a meditation cave 400 metres above Kedarnath will greet Modi during his visit this time. Built at a secluded spot 400 metres above the shrine, the cave will be shown to the prime minister from a distance as he is not scheduled to go there, Rudraprayag district magistrate Mangesh Ghildiyal said. Other new features for Modi to see at the shrine this time will be a much wider Mukhya Aksha, the passage from the point of confluence of Mandakini and Saraswati to the facade of the temple and the retaining walls constructed on the banks of the two rivers, the official said. Kedarpuri reconstruction has been on Modi's priority list and he keeps monitoring its progress on regular intervals via video conferencing. It would be his 10th visit to the state after assuming office in 2014.",
